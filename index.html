    <div class="job-time">
        <p>Department for Education — July 2020 to present</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>Work across 4 transactional services and smaller policy projects involving teacher recruitment in England.</p>
    
    <p>Manage a team of content designers by providing advice, reviewing work and getting the team to share skills and knowledge. For example – I got content designers to contribute to style guide to help us use consistent language in teacher recruitment.</p>
    
    <p>Collaborate across multidisciplinary teams with product managers, content and interactions designers, user researchers, business analysts and developers. For example – worked with our product manager and technical lead to prioritise content and design work for a large piece of work where we’re changing the process for how people apply for teacher training.</p>
    
    <p>Advocate for a user centred approach in service teams. For example – improved the way people write a ‘personal statement’ for teacher training by mapping the journey and using html prototyping, working with user researchers to test designs and advocating for a simpler solution that met user needs.</p>
    
    <p>Work with policy teams to make sure new policies are aligned to user needs. For example – distilling a 45 page policy document into 4 questions for users offering subject knowledge enhancement courses to people applying to teacher training.</p>
    
    <p>Use content and design patterns from the GOV.UK Design System to make sure content is accessible and consistent. For example – in 6 months redesigned a service built by developers in Microsoft Dynamics into an accessible and usable service to help users convert schools to academies.</p>
    
    <p>Developed a content strategy for a service as it moved from private to public beta to help users convert a school to an academy. This gave content design a ‘voice’ in the service line by highlighting who content designers collaborate with to create and manage content.</p>
    
    <p>Analyse user feedback to iterate and improve content, making sure it’s user-centred, while also following the GOV.UK style guide so content is consistent, accessible and understood. For example – analysed quantitative and qualitative research with a business analyst and user researcher to create an accessible way for users to compare data from one service with another.</p>

    <p>Map user journeys and design flows to scope work and provide content solutions at appropriate steps in the user journey. For example – worked with content designers to map email communications we send when users apply for teacher training, this helped refine and remove unnecessary content.</p>
    
    <p>Working with a design lead to understand the journey an international person takes to apply for teacher training in England. This work will lead to improvements across our services and highlight any gaps that content design can support like helping users understand the school and degree grades required to do teacher training.</p>
    
    <p>Record our user centred approach by writing <a href="https://becoming-a-teacher.design-history.education.gov.uk/">design histories</a> on features of work to share with other teams to advocate for user centred design. For example – wrote a story called <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/maeverose_when-franics-felt-frustrated-activity-7088063434704998400-fE34/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop">‘When Franics felt frustrated’</a> to help explain the pain points around a policy that needed improving and shared this with senior stakeholders.</p>
    
    <p>Contribute to the DfE content design community of practice through sharing work and helping others with theirs. For example – created guidance and supported content designers to use the GOV.UK prototyping kit to improve technical html, Nunjucks and GitHub skills in the department.</p>
    
    <p>Design assessor for DfE – assessed 3 government services to make sure they are meeting the 14 government Service Standards.</p>
